\subsection*{3.1}
\begin{proof} $ $ \newline
    Let $M≔\frac{1}{2}\left(x+y\right)$, thus $x<M<y$ \\
    Choose $ε=÷{\left|y-x\right|}{100}$ \\
    $𝕃_{n}\left(10^{-n}\right)=0$, which implies that $∃N∈ℕ$ such that $ε<10^{-N}$ \\
    Let $J≔M$ cut off at the N-th decimal, keeping leftward digits (and 0-ing rightward digits) \\
    As $J∈ℚ$, and $J∈\left[M-ε,M+ε\right]$, this is a rational number between $x$ and $y$. \\
    Let $H≔0.1*\sqrt{2}$ cut off at the N-th decimal, keeping rightward digits (and 0-ing leftward digits) \\
    Let $D≔H+J$ \\
    As an irrational number added or subtracted by a rational number is irrational,\\
    $D∈ℝ\backslashℚ$ and $D∈\left[M-2ε,M+2ε\right]$, which is between $x$ and $y$.
